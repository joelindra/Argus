# Argus
A sophisticated security tool designed to detect PHPUnit eval-stdin.php vulnerabilities in web applications. Named after Argus Panoptes, the all-seeing giant with a hundred eyes from Greek mythology, this tool vigilantly watches over web applications to identify vulnerable installations of PHPUnit that could lead to remote code execution.
